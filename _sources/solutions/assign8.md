# Assignment 8

## Doppler problem

- upload a pdf of the answer to the [Assignment 8 doppler problem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrIQnwRJGdkDhQyKtjNVtlctEZH0EgJc/view?usp=drive_link)

## Earthcare - GOES cloud heights

- upload a notebook that
  -  overlays your radar cases's ground track on the nearest GOES cloud height image using the code in {ref}`week12:goes_earthcare`
  - Add a function that locates image row/column values along the radar lat/lon coordinates
    of the GOES height image. Use it to produce a height/distance plot that shows the
    radar reflectivity image  with the colocated GOES HT heights overlaid as a line on the image.  Do
    GOES and eartcare agree on the location of cloudtop?
